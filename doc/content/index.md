### Fully Coupled THMC class=center style=font-weight:200;

FALCON is a true "fully-coupled" THMC simulator, using a finite-element approach to solve highly nonlinear coupled subsurface dynamics for problems such as carbon sequestration, reactive transport, geothermal energy, etc.

# A MOOSE-Based Application class=center style=clear:both;font-weight:200;font-size:200%

FALCON is built on the MOOSE framework and can efficiently solve problems using standard
workstations or very large high-performance computers in different dimensions, including full 3D, 2D, 2D-RZ axisymmetric, and 1D systems. Code reliability is paramount for the MOOSE framework, and MOOSE-based applications. FALCON employs a well-defined development and testing strategy in which code changes are only merged into the repository after both a manual code review and an automated regression test have been completed.

FALCON was originally developed by the Geothermal Energy Group at the [Idaho National Laboratory](http://inl.gov) by a team of computational scientists, applied mathematicians, and subsurface scientists.  Collaboration with the [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization](https://www.csiro.au/en/about/people/business-units/Mineral-Resources) has lead to many new enhancements.

Development has been supported by various funding agencies including the [United States Department of Energy](http://energy.gov) and [Idaho National Laboratory](http://inl.gov).
