FALCON
======

The FALCON is a finite-element, multiphysics code primarily developed by [Idaho National Laboratory](http://www.inl.gov). It provides a high-level interface to some of the most sophisticated [nonlinear solver technology](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) on the planet. MOOSE presents a straightforward API that aligns well with the real-world problems scientists and engineers need to tackle. Every detail about how an engineer interacts with MOOSE has been thought through, from the installation process through running your simulation on state of the art supercomputers, the MOOSE system will accelerate your research.

The FALCON is finite-element geothermal reservoir simulation and analysis code for coupled and fully implicit Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical-Chemical (THMC) geosystems based on the MOOSE framework mainly developed by [Idaho National Laboratory](http://www.inl.gov). It solves the coupled governing equations for fluid flow, heat transfer, rock deformation and fracturing, and chemical reactions in geological porous media. Due to the flexibility in the virtual abstract physics and transport interfaces, FALCON is highly extensible and can accommodate both multi-species and multi-phase formulations.

Some of the capability at your fingertips:

* Fully-coupled, fully-implicit solver
* Dimension independent physics
* Automatically parallel (largest runs >100,000 CPU cores!)
* Modular development simplifies code reuse
* Built-in mesh adaptivity
* Continuous and Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) (at the same time!)
* Dimension agnostic, parallel geometric search (for contact related applications)
* Flexible, plugable graphical user interface
* ~30 plugable interfaces allow specialization of every part of the solve
