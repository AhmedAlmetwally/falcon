# FALCON

FALCON is a finite-element geothermal reservoir simulation and analysis code for coupled and fully implicit Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical-Chemical (THMC) geosystems based on the MOOSE framework mainly developed by [Idaho National Laboratory](http://www.inl.gov). It solves the coupled governing equations for fluid flow, heat transfer, rock deformation and fracturing, and chemical reactions in geological porous media. Due to the flexibility in the virtual abstract physics and transport interfaces, FALCON is highly extensible and can accommodate both multi-species and multi-phase formulations.
