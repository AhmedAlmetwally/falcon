# This is a simple single-phase, non-isothermal, heat advection-diffusion problem on a 100mx10x1m column
# Temperature is initially 200 C.  A BC of 100 C is applied to the left-hand side of the column
# The standard GeothermalMaterial is used, with the water/steam EOS routine coupled in to determine variable
# density/viscosity.
# This is the same problem as T_CONST_STD_1D_1.i, but with variable fluid properties
